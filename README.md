# BattleBunnies

This is a game that was created as a final project for a course at my college. I worked with Riley Fiske and Emily Liddel to create this turn-based RPG fighting game. "\n"
My main contribution was to the creation of the Graphical User Interface, where I used the Java GUI tool in the Netbeans IDE to create the UI of the game. I focused on creating the base GUI template then converting it to actual code. I then helped write the code to integrate the GUI into the game. \n
I also contributed to creating and testing some of the unit test, for the base game but also testing the User Interface as well. \n
The game was codded to work without the GUI first and then implemented the UI elements in to finish the project. \n
This project was made before we had database experience so values for abilities are hard coded. \n
